In this notes we will learn about how to store data into the firebase and how to set up the project

step 1. open firebase - firebase.google.com
step 2. click on get started
step 3. make sure that you google account is logged in already
step 4. Enter your project name for ex - food-delevery-app
step 5. there is no use of analytics so you can close that 
step 6. click on create project, after 1 -2 min you project will be created
step 7. now your project is created, now look for the web icon </> like this , if you are not able to see this icon then you can get it on project settings
step 8. click on that icon </> then register you app, you can give any name like like food app, don't click on hosting you can do that separately afterwards
step 9. now run the command in your project terminal npx install firebase

step 10. now create a file in your project name FirebaseConfig.js and in the file copy this code which you have got from the firebase basically this contain the 
key and other detail related to the project that you have set up on firbase and this will help you in integrating your project with firebase


import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";

const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCB3bKjxCVw4d-Miwh8-8UO3i2eaNkGi50",
  authDomain: "food-delivery-app-1ab15.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "food-delivery-app-1ab15",
  storageBucket: "food-delivery-app-1ab15.appspot.com",
  messagingSenderId: "219053985271",
  appId: "1:219053985271:web:c47bd2b394c7e9b5a872f2"
};

step 11. now come to firebase cloude firestore, this is the place where you store the data , basically this is like a database where you can create table like 
struecture and store your data

step 12. inside cloud firestore click on create database 

step 13. inside rules set the read , write  to true, if they ask for publish then publish it 

step 14. after setting up the firebase cloud firestorage, you have to setup the storage, basically this part is for storing the document files like pdf, images 
this will we used to store the image of the foods , you cannot store them in firebase cloudfire

step 15. what we will do is that we will store the image in storage and we will get a link from there then that link we will store in cloud firestore and 
when we retrieve the data from the firestore we will get the link and from the link we will be able to see the image

step 16. in the stroge in the rule section you need to set the read , write to true and then publish it 

step 17. now for further part refer to the FirebaseConfig.js and AddFoodData.js files comments are written there
